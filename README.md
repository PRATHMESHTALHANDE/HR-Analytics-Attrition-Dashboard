# HR-Analytics-Attrition-Dashboard
I made HR Analytics dashboard on attrition data.

Source:-
csv file provided is the source of the dataset
The dataset is clean and there no need to go for power query. You can chech the Null value count is 0 when you transform data in power query.

PowerBI Dashboard
I tried to cover following aspects
1) Employee count, Attrition count, Onboard employees using KPI card
2) Attrition percentage using DAX
3) Average employees age using KPI and Filter in properties
4) Genderwise attrition rate piechart
5) Total attrition by education vertical bar graph
6) Job role satisfaction rating Matrix table
7) Attrition rate by Educationwise and Departmentwise Ring chart
8) Attrition rate by age band horizontal bar graph
9) Decomposition tree to understand attrition with different factors
10) Correlation with attrition rate and performance rating of the employees to decide which employees are more beneficial to company
11) Factor matrix table so that HR get idea that which employees getting promotion hike , their average age with company, average age with current manager, attrition rate and so on means all those factors can be used to retain employees.
